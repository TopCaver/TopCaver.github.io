title: 分布式数据网格 Data Mesh（draft）
tags: 技术 大数据 "Data Mesh"
--- 

ThoughtWorks最近一期的[技术雷达](https://www.thoughtworks.com/cn/radar/techniques/data-mesh)，把Data Mesh从“评估”调升到了“试验”。“试验”意味着这项技术“值得追求。重要的是理解如何建立这种能力。企业应该在风险可控的项目中尝试此技术。”

文章内容大部分来自 Zhamak Dehghani 的[《How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh》](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html) 讲了如何将单体的数据湖，变为分布式的数据网格（Data Mesh）。

我的个人理解是：未来可能企业将告别建造单体的数据湖，转而成为分布式的数据水系？

# 如何从单体数据湖演进到分布式数据网格
Many enterprises are investing in their next generation data lake, with the hope of democratizing data at scale to provide business insights and ultimately make automated intelligent decisions. Data platforms based on the data lake architecture have common failure modes that lead to unfulfilled promises at scale. To address these failure modes we need to shift from the centralized paradigm of a lake, or its predecessor data warehouse. We need to shift to a paradigm that draws from modern distributed architecture: considering domains as the first class concern, applying platform thinking to create self-serve data infrastructure, and treating data as a product.
许多企业都在投资建设自己的下一代数据湖，希望数据提供业务洞察力并做出智能决策。基于数据湖的数据平台架构，这样的单体架构存在共通的失效模式，导致不能达到之前承诺过的服务标准。为了解决这些问题，我们需要转变这种集中式的数据湖或者数仓。我们需要迁移到一种现代的分布式架构：将“领域”作为首要考虑的因素，运用平台化的思维创建自助型的数据基础设施，并且将数据也视作产品。

Becoming a data-driven organization remains one of the top strategic goals of many companies I work with. My clients are well aware of the benefits of becoming intelligently empowered: providing the best customer experience based on data and hyper-personalization; reducing operational costs and time through data-driven optimizations; and giving employees super powers with trend analysis and business intelligence. They have been investing heavily in building enablers such as data and intelligence platforms. Despite increasing effort and investment in building such enabling platforms, the organizations find the results middling.

建设数据驱动的组织，依旧是许多公司的首要目标。许多客户深知数据智能赋能企业带来的好处：基于数据与个性化提升的客户体验；数据驱动下的运营成本优化；通过趋势分析和BI为员工赋能。他们一直在大力投资构建数据和智能平台。尽管构建平台投入不菲，但是最后结果一般。

I agree that organizations face a multi-faceted complexity in transforming to become data-driven; migrating from decades of legacy systems, resistance of legacy culture to rely on data, and ever competing business priorities. However what I would like to share with you is an architectural perspective that underpins the failure of many data platform initiatives. I demonstrate how we can adapt and apply the learnings of the past decade in building distributed architectures at scale, to the domain of data; and I will introduce a new enterprise data architecture that I call data mesh.
必须承认组织在转型数据驱动时回面临诸多复杂问题：迁移十几年前的历史遗留系统，企业传统文化并不欢迎数据，以及难以平衡的业务优先级。我想分享的架构理念，正是基于这诸多失败的数据平台建造过程。借鉴过去十年间在建造分布式架构，引入数据领域，这项新的企业数据架构，我称之为——数据网格（Data Mesh）。

My ask before reading on is to momentarily suspend the deep assumptions and biases that the current paradigm of traditional data platform architecture has established; Be open to the possibility of moving beyond the monolithic and centralized data lakes to an intentionally distributed data mesh architecture; Embrace the reality of ever present, ubiquitous and distributed nature of data.
在继续阅读之前，放下对传统数据平台架构建设理念的固有思维，尽可能的抱着开放的心态拥抱分布式数据网格架构；面对这样一个事实：数据永远存在、无处不在、而且是分布式的。

The current enterprise data platform architecture
## 当前企业数据平台架构

It is centralized, monolithic and domain agnostic aka data lake.
当前企业的数据平台是：中心化、整体化、领域无关的，亦称数据湖。

Almost every client I work with is either planning or building their 3rd generation data and intelligence platform, while admitting the failures of the past generations:
我接触过的所有客户，都在正在或者计划构建他们的第三代数据智能平台，同时承认之前两代的不足：

    The first generation: proprietary enterprise data warehouse and business intelligence platforms; solutions with large price tags that have left companies with equally large amounts of technical debt; Technical debt in thousands of unmaintable ETL jobs, tables and reports that only a small group of specialized people understand, resulting in an under-realized positive impact on the business.
    * 第一代： 专有的企业数据仓库和BI平台；价格不菲的解决方案，同样留下了不小的技术债务；技术债务存在于数千个难以维护的ETL作业，表格和报告中，仅有少数人能够理解他们。
    The second generation: big data ecosystem with a data lake as a silver bullet; complex big data ecosystem and long running batch jobs operated by a central team of hyper-specialized data engineers have created data lake monsters that at best has enabled pockets of R&D analytics; over promised and under realized.
    * 第二代： 大数据生态构建的数据湖似乎是银弹；复杂的大数据生态系统，长时间执行的批处理作业由一小搓高度专业化的工程师构建和维护，他们创造了一个数据湖怪兽，充其量完成一些研发分析；承诺有余，兑现不足。

The third and current generation data platforms are more or less similar to the previous generation, with a modern twist towards (a) streaming for real-time data availability with architectures such as Kappa, (b) unifying the batch and stream processing for data transformation with frameworks such as Apache Beam, as well as (c) fully embracing cloud based managed services for storage, data pipeline execution engines and machine learning platforms. It is evident that the third generation data platform is addressing some of the gaps of the previous generations such as real-time data analytics, as well as reducing the cost of managing big data infrastructure. However it suffers from many of the underlying characteristics that led to the failures of the previous generations.

第三代数据平台和当前的架构或多或少有些类似，现代面向流的实时数据处理架构，比如Kappa； 批流一体的数据转换框架，比如Apache Beam；以及完全基于云的托管服务来存储、处理数据的管道以及机器学习平台。显而易见，第三代数据平台正在解决之前遇到的问题，比如实时数据处理，以及降低大数据基础设施的管理成本。但是，这种架构依然面临着和之前两代一样的潜在问题特征。

### 架构失效模式

To unpack the underlying limitations that all generations of data platforms carry, let's look at their architecture and their characteristics. In this writeup I use the domain of internet media streaming business such as Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple iTunes, etc. as the example to clarify some of the concepts.
为了解释这些数据平台面临的潜在问题，我们看一下这些架构的特征。在本文中，以互联网流媒体业务为例（像Spotify，SoundCloud，Apple iTunes等）来阐释一些概念。

#### 集中式和单体式

At 30,000 feet the data platform architecture looks like Figure 1 below; a centralized piece of architecture whose goal is to:
从三万英尺的高度看数据平台架构，就像下面图1所示。集中式的目标是：

    Ingest data from all corners of the enterprise, ranging from operational and transactional systems and domains that run the business, or external data providers that augment the knowledge of the enterprise. For example in a media streaming business, data platform is responsible for ingesting large variety of data: the 'media players performance', how their 'users interact with the players', 'songs they play', 'artists they follow', as well as 'labels and artists' that the business has onboarded, the 'financial transactions' with the artists, and external market research data such as 'customer demographic' information.
    * 从企业的各个角落获取数据，包括运营系统、交易系统等等，或者扩展出的外部数据供应商。例如在流媒体业务中，数据平台会负责摄取各种数据：“媒体播放器的性能”、“用户和播放器之间的交互”、“播放列表”、“关注的艺术家”、“艺术家和唱片公司”、和艺术家的“金融交易”，以及外部市场调研数据（比如客户人口统计信息）等等。
    Cleanse, enrich, and transform the source data into trustworthy data that can address the needs of a diverse set of consumers. In our example, one of the transformations turns the click streams of user interaction to meaningful sessions enriched with details of the user. This attempts to reconstruct the journey and behavior of the user into aggregate views.
    * 清洗，扩表，转换源数据到高质量数据，以满足数据消费端的需求。在我们的示例中，用户交互行为的点击流扩充上用户的详细信息，这种转换将重建用户行为到一个聚合视图。
    Serve the datasets to a variety of consumers with a diverse set of needs. This ranges from analytical consumption to exploring the data looking for insights, machine learning based decision making, to business intelligence reports that summarize the performance of the business. In our media streaming example, the platform can serve near real-time error and quality information about the media players around the globe through distributed log interfaces such as Kafka or serve the static aggregate views of a particular artist's records being played to drive financial payments calculation to the artists and labels.
    * 向不同的数据需求端提供数据，需要提供不同的数据。从数据中分析消费，通过机器学习制定决策，BI报表展示业务表现，需求各不相同。在我们的流媒体示例中，平台可以近实时的从Kafka等分布式日志系统接口中取得全球范围内播放器的错误和质量信息，或者提供某个艺术家的播放记录的聚合视图，以推动财务计算应付账款给艺术家和唱片公司。

![figure-1](../illustration/data-mesh-fig1.png)
图1：三万英尺俯瞰单体数据平台

It's an accepted convention that the monolithic data platform hosts and owns the data that logically belong to different domains, e.g. 'play events', 'sales KPIs', 'artists', 'albums', 'labels', 'audio', 'podcasts', 'music events', etc.; data from a large number of disparate domains.
单体架构平台上的集中托管的数据，在逻辑上属于不同领域，比如：“播放事件”、“销售KPI”、“艺术家”、“唱片”、“唱片公司”、“音频”、“播客”、“音乐活动”等等；这些数据来自大量不同领域。

While over the last decade we have successfully applied domain driven design and bounded context to our operational systems, we have largely disregarded the domain concepts in a data platform. We have moved away from domain oriented data ownership to a centralized domain agnostic data ownership. We pride ourselves on creating the biggest monolith of them all, the big data platform.
过去十年间，尽管我们成功地将领域驱动设计（Domain Driven Design,DDD）和边界上下文（Bounded Context）应用于操作系统，但是我们在数据平台中却忽略了领域的概念。我们已经不知不觉地从“面向领域数据所有权”转向了“集中式领域不可知的数据所有权”。我们以创建了最大的单体大数据平台而骄傲。

![figure-2](../illustration/data-mesh-fig2.png)
Figure 2: Centralized data platform with no clear data domain boundaries and ownership of domain oriented data
图2： 集中数据平台，没有明确的数据领域边界和面向领域数据的所有权。

While this centralized model can work for organizations that have a simpler domain with smaller number of diverse comsumption cases, it fails for enterprises with rich domains, a large number of sources and a diverse set of consumers.
集中式的模型适用于领域更简单，数据消费者数量较少的情况；对于领域丰富，数据生产来源众多，数据消费多样的企业并不适用。

There are two pressure points on the architecture and the organizational structure of a centralized data platform that often lead to its failure:
集中式的数据平台架构通常有两个承压点，经常导致数据平台是建设失败：

    Ubiquitous data and source proliferation: As more data becomes ubiquitously available, the ability to consume it all and harmonize it in one place under the control of one platform diminishes. Imagine just in the domain of 'customer information', there are an increasing number of sources inside and outside of the boundaries of the organization that provide information about the existing and potential customers. The assumption that we need to ingest and store the data in one place to get value from diverse set of sources is going to constrain our ability to respond to proliferation of data sources. I recognize the need for data users such as data scientists and analysts to process a diverse set of datasets with low overhead, as well as the need to separate the operational systems data usage from the data that is consumed for analytical purposes. But I propose that the existing centralized solution is not the optimal answer for large enterprises with rich domains and continuously added new sources.
    * 无处不在的数据和源的扩增：随着数据变得无处不在，想在一个平台的控制下的协调能力将会下降。想象一下，“客户信息”，在组织内外有各种各样的数据俩元，提供现存和潜在客户的信息。随着数据源的不断增加，我们需要从各个数据源接入并存储数据到单一的位置。至于数据用途，数据科学家和分析师等希望低成本的处理各个数据集，运营目的的数据使用和分析目的的数据使用也是并不相同。我的建议是，现有的集中式的解决方案，不是具有多领域，持续新增数据源的大企业的最佳解决方案。
    Organizations' innovation agenda and consumer proliferation: Organizations' need for rapid experimentation introduces a larger number of use cases for consumption of the data from the platform. This implies an ever growing number of transformations on the data - aggregates, projections and slices that can satisfy the test and learn cycle of innovation. The long response time to satisfy the data consumer needs has historically been a point of organizational friction and remains to be so in the modern data platform architecture.
    * 组织创新和数据消费多元化：组织需要快速验证的需求引入了大量的数据消费的用例。这意味着数据转换的数量也不断增长-聚合、投影、切片，以满足创新的测试和学习。长期以来，如何快速满足数据使用者的需求，一直是组织面临的问题，并且在现代数据平台架构中依然如此。

While I don't want to give my solution away just yet, I need to clarify that I'm not advocating for a fragmented, siloed domain-oriented data often hidden in the bowels of operational systems; siloed domain data that is hard to discover, make sense of and consume. I am not advocating for multiple fragmented data warehouses that are the results of years of accumulated tech debt. This is a concern that leaders in the industry have voiced. But I argue that the response to these accidental silos of unreachable data is not creating a centralized data platform, with a centralized team who owns and curates the data from all domains. It does not organizationally scale as we have learned and demonstrated above.
我需要澄清的是，我并不是要鼓吹之前那种隐藏在各个系统中的、分散、独立、烟筒似的领域数据，这样的数据难以发现、理解和使用。也不是鼓吹由于多年积累的技术债务导致的分散成的多个数据仓库。这是一些行业领军者需要关注的地方。而我的观点是，解决这些无法访问的数据孤岛问题，不是建立一个集中的数据平台，再建立一个中心化的团队。这样会遇到我们前面提到的扩展性的问题。

#### 分解耦合数据管道 Coupled pipeline decomposition

The second failure mode of a traditional data platform architecture is related to how we decompose the architecture. At 10,000 feet zooming into the centralized data platform, what we find is an architectural decomposition around the mechanical functions of ingestion, cleansing, aggregation, serving, etc. Architects and technical leaders in organizations decompose an architecture in response to the growth of the platform. As described in the previous section, the need for on-boarding new sources, or responding to new consumers requires the platform to grow. Architects need to find a way to scale the system by breaking it down to its architectural quanta. An architectural quantum, as described in Building Evolutionary Architectures, is an independently deployable component with high functional cohesion, which includes all the structural elements required for the system to function properly. The motivation behind breaking a system down into its architectural quantum is to create independent teams who can each build and operate an architectural quantum. Parallelize work across these teams to reach higher operational scalability and velocity.
传统数据平台架构的第二个失效模式是我们如何分解体系结构。在一万英尺看大数据平台的时候，我们会发现数据架构围绕摄取、清洗、聚合、服务等功能进行分解。架构师或者技术领导会根据平台的增长进一步分解体系架构。架构师需要找到一个扩展系统，将其分解到架构单元（architectural quanta）。在《演进式构建》的描述中中，一个架构单元是一个具备完整功能、高内聚的、可独立部署的组件。将系统分解为单一结构单元的初衷，式创立独立的团队，每个人都可以构建和维护这个结构单元。团队之间并行工作可以达到更高的扩展性和速度。

Given the influence of previous generations of data platforms' architecture, architects decompose the data platform to a pipeline of data processing stages. A pipeline that at a very high level implements a functional cohesion around the technical implementation of processing data; i.e. capabilities of ingestion, preparation, aggregation, serving, etc.
考虑到前几代数据平台架构的影响，架构师将数据平台分解为一系列的数据处理阶段。围绕数据处理的技术实现，通过一条流水线实现一系列功能聚合。包括了数据摄取、预处理、聚合、服务等功能。

![figure-3](../illustration/data-mesh-fig3.png)
Figure 3: Architectural decomposition of data platform
图3：数据平台的架构分解

Though this model provides some level of scale, by assigning teams to different stages of the pipeline, it has an inherent limitation that slows the delivery of features. It has high coupling between the stages of the pipeline to deliver an independent feature or value. It's decomposed orthogonally to the axis of change.
尽管此模型提供了一定范围的扩展，将团队分配到不同的数据流水线的不同阶段，具有一个固有的局限性，使功能交付速度变慢。整条流水线在各个阶段都具有很高的耦合性。它的结构分解正交于变化轴。

Let's look at our media streaming example. Internet media streaming platforms have a strong domain construct around the type of media that they offer. They often start their services with 'songs' and 'albums', and then extend to 'music events', 'podcasts', 'radio shows', 'movies', etc. Enabling a single new feature, such as visibility to the 'podcasts play rate', requires a change in all components of the pipeline. Teams must introduce new ingestion services, new cleansing and preparation as well as aggregates for viewing podcast play rates. This requires synchronization across implementation of different components and release management across teams. Many data platforms provide generic and configuration-based ingestion services that can cope with extensions such as adding new sources easily or modifying the existing sources to minimize the overhead of introducing new sources. However this does not remove an end to end dependency management of introducing new datasets from the consumer point of view. Though on paper, the pipeline architecture might appear as if we have achieved an architectural quantum of a pipeline stage, in practice the whole pipeline i.e. the monolithic platform, is the smallest unit that must change to cater for a new functionality: unlocking a new dataset and making it available for new or existing consumption. This limits our ability to achieve higher velocity and scale in response to new consumers or sources of the data.
让我们看一下流媒体实例。互联网流媒体平台围绕他们的媒体类型，具有强大的领域构造能力。他们通常以“歌曲”和“”专辑“开始服务，然后扩展到”音乐活动“、”播客“、”电台SHOW“、”电影“等等。启用单一新功能，例如”播客播放率“，需要修改整个管道上的所有组件。团队必须引入新的摄取数据的服务、新的清理数据和预处理数据的服务、新的聚合的服务，直到最后展示播客播放率的视图。这要求在不同的组件之间实现同步，并在团队之间进行发布管理。许多数据平台提供了通用的和基于配置的数据提取服务，可以应对扩展的需求，以减少引入新资源的开销。但是这并没有消除从消费者角度引入的新数据集的端到端的依赖性管理。流水线架构从表面上看，流水线的各个阶段已经是一个单一架构单元，但是对于整个单体平台，整条流水线才是最小的单元，新的数集从录入到使用必须要改变整条流水线。这就限制了我们快速响应新的数据源或者数据用户规模扩大。

![figure-4](../illustration/data-mesh-fig4.png)
图4：新增或改进功能时，架构的分解和对应的变化是正交的，从而导致耦合和交付变慢。
Figure 4: Architecture decomposition is orthogonal to the axis of change when introducing or enhancing features, leading to coupling and slower delivery

#### 孤立且超专业的所有者 Siloed and hyper-specialized ownership

The third failure mode of today's data platforms is related to how we structure the teams who build and own the platform. When we zoom close enough to observe the life of the people who build and operate a data platform, what we find is a group of hyper-specialized data engineers siloed from the operational units of the organization; where the data originates or where it is used and put into actions and decision making. The data platform engineers are not only siloed organizationally but also separated and grouped into a team based on their technical expertise of big data tooling, often absent of business and domain knowledge.
当前数据平台的第三个失效模式与我们如何建立平台团队有关系。当我们近距离观察这些构建和维护数据平台的工程师们，会发现他们是一群超专业的数据工程师，和那些数据来源或者使用的部门是隔离的。数据平台工程师通常不仅组织结构上的独立，而且由于他们具备大数据工具的专业经验却缺乏业务和领域知识，被分成一个独立的团队。

![figure-5](../illustration/data-mesh-fig5.png)
图5：专业且独立的数据平台团队
Figure 5: Siloed hyper-specialized data platform team

I personally don't envy the life of a data platform engineer. They need to consume data from teams who have no incentive in providing meaningful, truthful and correct data. They have very little understanding of the source domains that generate the data and lack the domain expertise in their teams. They need to provide data for a diverse set of needs, operational or analytical, without a clear understanding of the application of the data and access to the consuming domain's experts.
我个人并不羡慕平台工程师的工作。他们需要从其他团队消费数据，但是其他团队并没有动力提供真实、准确、有意义的数据。他们对生产数据的领域知之甚少，缺乏专业知识。他们需要为各需求方提供数据，但同时对数据消费者的领域知识也不了解。

In the media streaming domain, for example, on the source end we have cross-functional 'media player' teams that provide signals around how users interact with a particular feature they provide e.g. 'play song events', 'purchase events', 'play audio quality', etc.; and on the other end sit the consumer cross-functional teams such as 'song recommendation' team, 'sales team' reporting sales KPIs, 'artists payment team' who calculate and pay artists based on play events, and so on. Sadly, in the middle sits the data platform team that through sheer effort provides suitable data for all sources and consumptions.
在流媒体领域，在源端，我们有跨职能的”媒体播放器“团队，提供关于用户如何使用功能的交互信息，比如”播放乐曲事件“、”购买事件“、”播放音频质量“等等；在另一端，是跨职能的数据消费团队，例如”歌曲推荐“团队，销售团队报告销售KPI，对外支付团队通过计算播放事件支付给艺术家款项，等等。不幸的是，中间的数据平台团队需要付诸全力来为生产端和消费端提供合适的数据。

In reality what we find are disconnected source teams, frustrated consumers fighting for a spot on top of the data platform team backlog and an over stretched data platform team.
实际上，我们发现数据平台团队与数据生产端失去联系，又被数据消费端争抢工作排期，导致数据平台团队被过度拉伸。

We have created an architecture and organization structure that does not scale and does not deliver the promised value of creating a data-driven organization.
我们当前创建的架构和组织结构无法扩展，也不能实现创建数据驱动型组织时做出的承诺。

## 下一代企业数据平台架构 The next enterprise data platform architecture

It embraces the ubiquitous data with a distributed Data Mesh.
使用分布式数据网格（Data Mesh）拥抱无处不在的数据。

So what is the answer to the failure modes and characteristics we discussed above? In my opinion a paradigm shift is necessary. A paradigm shift at the intersection of techniques that have been instrumental in building modern distributed architecture at scale; Techniques that the tech industry at large has adopted at an accelerated rate and that have created successful outcomes.
针对上面讨论的失效模式，我们的应对是什么？我认为时进行必要的范式转换。在构建大规模分布式体系架构中应用的范式转变，业内已经加速采用并取得了不错的成果。

I suggest that the next enterprise data platform architecture is in the convergence of Distributed Domain Driven Architecture, Self-serve Platform Design, and Product Thinking with Data.
我建议下一代企业数据平台架构会融合：分布式领域驱动架构（Distributed Domain Driven Architecture），自助平台设计（Self-serve Platform Design），以及数据产品思想（Product Thinking with Data）

![figure-6](../illustration/data-mesh-fig6.png)
图6：融合：范式转变，构建下一代数据平台
Figure 6: Convergence: the paradigm shift for building the next data platforms

Though this might sound like a lot of buzzwords in one sentence, each of these techniques have had a specific and incredibly positive impact in modernizing the technical foundations of operational systems. Lets deep dive into how we can apply each of these disciplines to the world of Data to escape the current paradigm, carried over from years of legacy data warehousing architecture.
尽管听起来有很多时髦的词，但这些技术在现代操作系统的特定方面产生了重大的积极影响。让我深入研究如何将这些学科应用于数据领域，以摆脱多年来陈旧的数仓体系结构。

### 数据 与 分布式领域驱动架构的融合 Data and distributed domain driven architecture convergence

#### 面向领域的数据分解和归属 Domain oriented data decomposition and ownership

Eric Evans's book Domain-Driven Design has deeply influenced modern architectural thinking, and consequently the organizational modeling. It has influenced the microservices architecture by decomposing the systems into distributed services built around business domain capabilities. It has fundamentally changed how the teams form, so that a team can independently and autonomously own a domain capability.
埃里克·埃文斯（Eric Evans）的著作《域驱动设计》（Domain-Driven Design）深刻地影响了现代建筑思想，也影响了组织建模。它通过将系统分解为围绕业务域功能构建的分布式服务来影响微服务体系结构。从根本上改变了团队的组成方式，从而使团队可以独立自主地拥有领域能力。

Though we have adopted domain oriented decomposition and ownership when implementing operational capabilities, curiously we have disregarded the notion of business domains when it comes to data. The closest application of DDD in data platform architecture is for source operational systems to emit their business Domain Events and for monolithic data platform to ingest them. However beyond the point of ingestion the concept of domains and the ownership of the domain data by different teams is lost.
尽管在运营时我们采用了面向领域的分解和归属，但奇怪的是，在涉及数据时，我们却忽略了业务领域的概念。在数据平台体系结构中最接近DDD概念的应用，是源端系统发出业务领域的事件，并由数据平台来接收它们。但是，在此之外，就失去了领域的概念以及不同团队对领域数据的所有权。

Domain Bounded Context is a wonderfully powerful tool to design the ownership of the datasets. Ben Stopford's Data Dichotomy article unpacks the concept of sharing of domain datasets through streams.
领域边界上下文是设计数据集归属的有力工具。Ben Stopford的《Data Dichotomy》一文介绍了通过流共享领域数据集的概念。

In order to decentralize the monolithic data platform, we need to reverse how we think about data, it's locality and ownership. Instead of flowing the data from domains into a centrally owned data lake or platform, domains need to host and serve their domain datasets in an easily consumable way.
为了数据平台的去中心化，我们需要逆向思考我们的数据，他们的位置和归属。不同于数据从所属的领域流向数据湖或平台，领域需要以便于消费的方式保存他们的数据集并提供服务。

In our example, instead of imagining data flowing from media players into some sort of centralized place for a centralized team to receive, why not imagine a player domain owning and serving their datasets for access by any team for any purpose downstream. The physical location where the datasets actually reside and how they flow, is a technical implementation of the 'player domain'. The physical storage could certainly be a centralized infrastructure such as Amazon S3 buckets but player datasets content and ownership remains with the domain generating them. Similarly in our example, the 'recommendations' domain creates datasets in a format that is suitable for its application, such as a graph database, while consuming the player datasets. If there are other domains such as 'new artist discovery domain' which find the 'recommendation domain' graph dataset useful, they can choose to pull and access that.
在我们的例子中，与其让数据里从媒体播放器流入中心数据平台，不如思考播放器域自己所有数据并提供服务，让其他下游团队进行访问。数据集存储在哪里，如何流动，这是”播放器域“自己的技术实现。物理存储肯定可以说是诸如Amazon S3的存储这样的基础架构，但是数据的内容和归属依然属于生产它的团队。类似的，”推荐域“创建适合他们业务的数据集格式，比如消费”播放器域“的数据，保存到图数据库存储。如果其他领域，例如”发现新歌手“领域发现”推荐领域“的图数据集有意义，他们可以选择拉取和访问这些数据。

This implies that we may duplicate data in different domains as we transform them into a shape that is suitable for that particular domain, e.g. a time series play event to related artists graph.
这意味着，我们可能需要复制数据，并在不同的领域中做一些变化以适应新的领域。例如将时间序列的播放事件，转换为歌手相关的图。

This requires shifting our thinking from a push and ingest, traditionally through ETLs and more recently through event streams, to serving and pull model across all domains.
我们需要转变思想，从推送和摄取（传统的通过ETL和事件流），转换到跨领域的服务和拉取模型。

The architectural quantum in a domain oriented data platform, is a domain and not the pipeline stage.
在面向领域数据平台中基本的架构单元式领域，而不是数据流水线上的不同阶段。

![figure-6](../illustration/data-mesh-fig7.png)
图7：根据领域分解拥有数据的架构和团队。
Figure 7: Decomposing the architecture and teams owning the data based on domains - source, consumer, and newly created shared domains

#### 面向源的领域数据  Source oriented domain data

Some domains naturally align with the source, where the data originates. The source domain datasets represent the facts and reality of the business. The source domain datasets capture the data that is mapped very closely to what the operational systems of their origin, systems of reality, generate. In our example facts of the business such as 'how the users are interacting with the services', or 'the process of onboarding labels' lead to creation of domain datasets such as 'user click streams', 'audio play quality stream' and 'onboarded labels'. These facts are best known and generated by the operational systems that sit at the point of origin. For example the media player system knows best about the 'user click streams'.
一些领域和源数据的组成是天然一致的。源领域数据集，展示的是业务上的事实。原领域数据集对应是原始业务系统中的数据，代表实际的系统生成的数据。在我们的示例中，”用户如何使用服务“、”标记流程“这样的业务实际创建数据的数据，例如”用户点击流“、”音频播放质量流“、”标签“。这些是数据就是由原始业务系统生成的，媒体播放器最清楚”用户点击流“

In a mature and ideal situation, an operational system and it's team or organizational unit, are not only responsible for providing business capabilities but also responsible for providing the truths of their business domain as source domain datasets. At enterprise scale there is never a one to one mapping between a domain concept and a source system. There are often many systems that can serve parts of the data that belongs to a domain, some legacy and some easy to change. Hence there might be many source aligned datasets aka reality datasets that ultimately need to be aggregated to a cohesive domain aligned dataset.
在理想情况下，一个业务系统和它的业务团队，除了负责提供业务能力，也要提供他们领域的源数据集。在企业中，没有一对一的领域和源系统的对应关系。他们通常是许多系统，各自提供一部分数据属于同一个领域，有些事旧系统，有些易改动。因此这里由许多源数据集需要对齐（事实数据集），最终需要汇聚成为一个内聚的领域对齐的数据集。

The business facts are best presented as business Domain Events, can be stored and served as distributed logs of time-stamped events for any authorized consumer to access.
业务事实，最佳的表现形式是”业务领域事实“，存储带有时间戳的事件的分布式日志，供授权数据消费者访问。

In addition to timed events, source data domains should also provide easily consumable historical snapshots of the source domain datasets, aggregated over a time interval that closely reflects the interval of change for their domain. For example in an 'onboarded labels' source domain, which shows the labels of the artists that provide music to the streaming business, aggregating the onboarded labels on a monthly basis is a reasonable view to provide in addition to the events generated through the process of onboarding labels.
除了时序事件外，源数据域还应该提供源域数据集的易与消费使用的历史快照，这些快照在一定时间间隔内汇总，以紧密反映其领域的变化。例如，在“内嵌标签”源域中，该域显示了向流媒体业务提供音乐的艺术家的标签，每月汇总一种合理的视图。（此处翻译存疑）

Note that the source aligned domain datasets must be separated from the internal source systems' datasets. The nature of the domain datasets is very different from the internal data that the operational systems use to do their job. They have a much larger volume, represent immutable timed facts, and change less frequently than their systems. For this reason the actual underlying storage must be suitable for big data, and separate from the existing operational databases. Section Data and self-serve platform design convergence describes how to create big data storage and serving infrastructure.
注意，对齐后的源域数据集必须与内部源系统的数据集分开。领域数据集的性质与运营系统用来完成其工作的内部数据有很大不同。与它们的系统相比，它们具有更大的体积，代表不变的定时事实，并且更改频率较低。因此，实际的基础存储必须适合大数据，并且必须与现有的操作数据库分开。数据和自助服务平台的设计融合部分章节，介绍如何创建大数据存储和服务的基础设施。

Source domain datasets are the most foundational datasets and change less often, as the facts of business don't change that frequently. These domain datasets are expected to be permanently captured and made available, so that as the organization evolves its data-driven and intelligence services they can always go back to the business facts, and create new aggregations or projections.
源域数据集是最基础的数据集，并且更改频率较低，因为业务事实并不经常更改。预计这些域数据集将被永久捕获并变得可用，因此随着组织发展其数据驱动的和情报服务，他们可以始终追溯到业务事实，并创建新的汇总或预测。

Note that source domain datasets represent closely the raw data at the point of creation, and are not fitted or modeled for a particular consumer.
请注意，源域数据集在创建时几乎代表原始数据，并且未针对特定使用者进行拟合或建模。

#### 面向消费的共享领域数据 Consumer oriented and shared domain data

Some domains align closely with the consumption. The consumer domain datasets and the teams who own them, aim to satisfy a closely related group of use cases. For example the 'social recommendation domain' that focuses on providing recommendations based on users social connections to each other, create domain datasets that fit this specific need; perhaps through a 'graph representation of social network of users'. While this graph dataset is useful for recommendation use case, it might be also useful for a 'listeners notifications' domain, which provides data regarding different types of notifications that are sent to the listener, including what people in their social network are listening to. So it is possible that 'user social network' can become a shared and newly reified domain dataset for multiple consumers to use. The 'user social network' domain team focuses on providing an always curated and uptodate view of the 'user social network'.
一些领域与数据消费密切相关。数据消费端的领域数据集和其团队旨在满足一组密切相关的用例。例如，“社交推荐领域”侧重于根据用户之间的社交联系提供推荐，创建适合此特定需求的域数据集；也许通过“用户社交网络的图形表示”。虽然此图数据集对于推荐用例很有用，但对于“听众通知”领域也可能有用，该域提供有关发送给听众的不同类型的通知的数据，包括其社交网络中的人正在听的内容。因此，“用户社交网络”有可能成为共享的和新定义的领域数据集，供多个消费者使用。 “用户社交网络”域团队致力于提供“用户社交网络”的始终精选和最新视图。

The consumer aligned domain datasets have a different nature in comparison to source domains datasets. They structurally go through more changes, and they transform the source domain events to aggregate views and structures that fit a particular access model, such as the graph example we saw above. A domain oriented data platform should be able to easily regenerate these consumer datasets from the source.
消费者对齐的域数据集与源域数据集相比具有不同的性质。它们在结构上进行了更多更改，并且将源域事件转换为聚合适合特定访问模型的视图和结构，例如我们上面看到的图形示例。面向领域的数据平台应该能够轻松地从源头重新生成这些消费者数据集。

#### 分布式数据流水线作为领域内部实现 Distributed pipelines as domain internal implementation

While the datasets ownership is delegated from the central platform to the domains, the need for cleansing, preparing, aggregating and serving data remains, so does the usage of data pipeline. In this architecture, a data pipeline is simply an internal complexity and implementation of the data domain and is handled internally within the domain. As a result we will be seeing a distribution of the data pipelines stages into each domain.
尽管将数据集所有权从中央平台委派给域，但仍然需要清理，准备，聚合和提供数据，数据管道的使用也是如此。在这种体系结构中，数据管道只是内部复杂性和数据域的实现，并在该域内部进行处理。结果，我们将看到数据管道阶段分布到每个域中。

For example the source domains need to include the cleansing, deduplicating, enriching of their domain events so that they can be consumed by other domains, without replication of cleansing. Each domain dataset must establish a Service Level Objectives for the quality of the data it provides: timeliness, error rates, etc. For example our media player domain providing audio 'play clickstream' can include cleansing and standardizing data pipeline in their domain that provides a stream of de-duped near real-time 'play audio click events' that conform to the organization's standards of encoding events.
例如，源域需要包括对其域事件的清除，重复数据删除，扩展，以便其他域可以使用它们，而无需复制清除。每个域数据集都必须为其提供的数据质量建立 服务水平目标：及时性，错误率等。例如，我们提供音频“播放点击流”的媒体播放器域可以在其域中清理和标准化数据管道，从而提供重复数据消除的近实时“播放音频单击事件”，符合组织的编码事件标准。

Equally, we will see that aggregation stages of a centralized pipeline move into implementation details of consuming domains.
同样，我们将看到集中式管道的聚合阶段进入了使用域的实现细节。

![figure-8](data-mesh-fig8.png)
图8：将管道分配到域中作为第二类关注点，以及域的内部实现细节 
Figure 8: Distribute the pipelines into the domains as a second class concern and the domain's internal implementation detail

One might argue that this model might lead to duplicated effort in each domain to create their own data processing pipeline implementation, technology stack and tooling. I will address this concern shortly as we talk about the Convergence of Data and Platform Thinking with Self-serve shared Data Infrastructure as a Platform.
有人可能会争辩说，该模型可能会导致每个领域在创建自己的数据处理管道实现，技术堆栈和工具方面做出重复的努力。我将在谈论 自助共享数据基础架构作为平台的数据和平台思维的融合时，很快就解决这个问题 。

### 数据和产品思维融合 Data and product thinking convergence

Distribution of the data ownership and data pipeline implementation into the hands of the business domains raise an important concern around accessibility, usability and harmonization of distributed datasets. This is where the learning in applying product thinking and ownership of data assets come handy.
将数据所有权和数据管道实现分配到业务领域之内引起了对分布式数据集的可访问性，可用性和协调性的重要关注。在这里，应用产品思想和数据资产所有权的学习 非常方便。


#### 域数据作为产品 Domain data as a product

Over the last decade operational domains have built product thinking into the capabilities they provide to the rest of the organization. Domain teams provide these capabilities as APIs to the rest of the developers in the organization, as building blocks of creating higher order value and functionality. The teams strive for creating the best developer experience for their domain APIs; including discoverable and understandable API documentation, API test sandboxes, and closely tracked quality and adoption KPIs.
在过去的十年中，运营领域已将 产品思想 融入到他们为组织其他部门提供的功能中。领域团队将这些功能作为API提供给组织中其他开发人员，作为创建更高订单价值和功能的基础。这些团队致力于为他们的域API创建最佳的开发人员体验；包括可发现且易于理解的API文档，API测试沙箱以及密切跟踪的质量和采用KPI。

For a distributed data platform to be successful, domain data teams must apply product thinking with similar rigor to the datasets that they provide; considering their data assets as their products and the rest of the organization's data scientists, ML and data engineers as their customers.
为了使分布式数据平台成功，领域数据团队必须对他们提供的数据集进行严格的产品思考。将数据资产视为产品，并将组织的其余数据科学家，机器学习和数据工程师视为客户。

![figure-9](data-mesh-fig9.png)
图9：域数据集作为产品的特征
Figure 9: Characteristics of domain datasets as product

Consider our example, internet media streaming business. One of its critical domains is the 'play events', what songs have been played by whom, when and where. This key domain has different consumers in the organization; for example near real-time consumers that are interested in the experience of the user and possibly errors so that in case of a degraded customer experience or an incoming customer support call can respond quickly to recover the error. There are also a few consumers that would prefer the historical snapshots of the daily, or monthly song play event aggregates.
考虑我们的示例，互联网媒体流业务。它的关键领域之一是“播放事件”，即谁，何时，何地播放了哪些歌曲。这个关键领域在组织中有不同的使用者；例如，对用户体验以及可能的错误感兴趣的近实时消费者，以便在客户体验下降或客户支持电话打入的情况下可以快速响应以恢复错误。也有一些消费者更喜欢每日或每月歌曲播放事件汇总的历史快照。

In this case our 'played songs' domain provides two different datasets as its products to the rest of the organization; real-time play events exposed on event streams, and aggregated play events exposed as serialized files on an object store.
在这种情况下，我们的“播放的歌曲”域为组织的其他部分提供了两个不同的数据集作为产品。在事件流上公开的实时播放事件，以及在对象存储中公开为序列化文件的聚合播放事件。

An important quality of any technical product, in this case domain data products, is to delight their consumers; in this case data engineers, ml engineers or data scientists. To provide the best user experience for consumers, the domain data products need to have the following basic qualities:
任何技术产品（在这种情况下是领域数据产品）的一项重要素质就是使他们的消费者满意。在这种情况下，数据工程师，毫升工程师或数据科学家。为了向消费者提供最佳的用户体验，域数据产品需要具有以下基本素质：

##### 可发现  Discoverable

A data product must be easily discoverable. A common implementation is to have a registry, a data catalogue, of all available data products with their meta information such as their owners, source of origin, lineage, sample datasets, etc. This centralized discoverability service allows data consumers, engineers and scientists in an organization, to find a dataset of their interest easily. Each domain data product must register itself with this centralized data catalogue for easy discoverability.
数据产品必须易于发现。常见的实现方式是对所有可用数据产品及其元信息（例如其所有者，来源来源，血统，样本数据集等）进行注册，数据目录编制。该集中式可发现性服务允许数据消费者，工程师和科学家组织，以轻松找到他们感兴趣的数据集。每个域数据产品都必须在此集中式数据目录中注册以方便发现。

Note the perspective shift here is from a single platform extracting and owning the data for its use, to each domain providing its data as a product in a discoverable fashion.
请注意，这里的观点转变是从单个平台提取并拥有 供其使用的数据，到以可发现的方式将其数据作为产品提供的每个域。 

##### 可寻址的 Addressable

A data product, once discovered, should have a unique address following a global convention that helps its users to programmatically access it. The organizations may adopt different naming conventions for their data, depending on the underlying storage and format of the data. Considering the ease of use as an objective, in a decentralized architecture, it is necessary for common conventions to be developed. Different domains might store and serve their datasets in different formats, events might be stored and accessed through streams such as Kafka topics, columnar datasets might use CSV files, or AWS S3 buckets of serialized Parquet files. A standard for addressability of datasets in a polyglot environment removes friction when finding and accessing information.
数据产品一旦发现，应遵循全局约定，以帮助其用户以编程方式访问它的唯一地址。根据数据的基础存储和格式，组织可以为数据采用不同的命名约定。考虑到易用性，在一个分散的体系结构中，有必要制定通用的约定。不同的域可能以不同的格式存储和提供其数据集，事件可能通过诸如Kafka主题之类的流进行存储和访问，柱状数据集可能使用CSV文件或序列化Parquet的AWS S3存储桶文件。多种语言环境中的数据集可寻址性标准消除了查找和访问信息时的摩擦。

##### 诚实守信 Trustworthy and truthful

No one will use a product that they can't trust. In the traditional data platforms it's acceptable to extract and onboard data that has errors, does not reflect the truth of the business and simply can't be trusted. This is where the majority of the efforts of centralized data pipelines are concentrated, cleansing data after ingestion.
没有人会使用他们不信任的产品。在传统的数据平台中，可以提取并装载有错误，不能反映业务真相并且根本无法信任的数据。在这里，集中式数据管道的大部分工作都集中在此，在提取数据后清理数据。

A fundamental shift requires the owners of the data products to provide an acceptable Service Level Objective around the truthfulness of the data, and how closely it reflects the reality of the events that have occurred or the high probability of the truthfulness of the insights that have been generated. Applying data cleansing and automated data integrity testing at the point of creation of the data product are some of the techniques to be utilized to provide an acceptable level of quality. Providing data provenance and data lineage as the metadata associated with each data product helps consumers gain further confidence in the data product and its suitability for their particular needs.
根本性的转变要求数据产品的所有者围绕数据的真实性提供可接受的服务水平目标，以及它与事件发生的真实性或已发现的洞察的真实性的高可能性之间的接近程度。产生。在创建数据产品时应用数据清理和自动数据完整性测试是可用来提供可接受质量水平的一些技术。提供数据来源和数据沿袭 因为与每个数据产品相关的元数据有助于消费者进一步信任数据产品及其对特定需求的适用性。

The target value or range of a data integrity (quality) indicator vary between domain data products. For example, 'play event' domain may provide two different data products, one near-real-time with lower level of accuracy, including missing or duplicate events, and one with longer delay and higher level of events accuracy. Each data product defines and assure the target level of its integrity and truthfulness as a set of SLOs.
数据完整性（质量）指标的目标值或范围在域数据产品之间有所不同。例如，“播放事件”域可以提供两种不同的数据产品，一种接近实时，准确性较低，包括丢失或重复的事件，而另一种则具有较长的延迟和较高的事件准确性。每个数据产品作为一组SLO定义并确保其完整性和真实性的目标级别。

##### 自我描述的语义和语法 Self-describing semantics and syntax

Quality products require no consumer hand holding to be used: they can be independently discovered, understood and consumed. Building datasets as products with minimum friction for the data engineers and data scientists to use requires well described semantics and syntax of the data, ideally accompanied with sample datasets as exemplars. Data schemas are a starting point to provide self-serve data assets.
优质的产品不需要消费者手持即可使用：可以独立地发现，理解和消费它们。将数据集构建为具有最小摩擦力的产品，以供数据工程师和数据科学家使用，这需要对数据进行充分描述的语义和语法，理想情况下还应将示例数据集作为示例。数据模式是提供自助数据资产的起点。

##### 可互操作并受全球标准约束 Inter-operable and governed by global standards

One of the main concerns in a distributed domain data architecture, is the ability to correlate data across domains and stitch them together in wonderful, insightful ways; join, filter, aggregate, etc. The key for an effective correlation of data across domains is following certain standards and harmonization rules. Such standardizations should belong to a global governance, to enable interoperability between polyglot domain datasets. Common concerns of such standardization efforts are field type formatting, identifying polysemes across different domains, datasets address conventions, common metadata fields, event formats such as CloudEvents, etc.
分布式域数据体系结构的主要问题之一是跨域关联数据并将其以奇妙，有见地的方式缝合在一起的能力。连接，过滤，聚合等。跨域有效关联数据的关键是遵循某些标准和统一规则。此类标准化应属于全球治理，以实现多语言域数据集之间的互操作性。此类标准化工作的共同关注点是字段类型格式化，跨不同域识别多义词，数据集地址约定，公共元数据字段，事件格式（例如CloudEvents等）。

For example in the media streaming business, an 'artist' might appear in different domains and have different attributes and identifiers in each domain. The 'play eventstream' domain may recognize the artist differently to 'artists payment' domain that takes care of invoices and payments. However to be able to correlate the data about an artist across different domain data products we need to agree on how we identify an artist as a polyseme. One approach is to consider 'artist' with a federated entity and a unique global federated entity identifier for the 'artist', similarly to how federated identities are managed.
例如，在媒体流业务中，“艺术家”可能出现在不同的域中，并且在每个域中具有不同的属性和标识符。 “播放事件流”域对艺术家的识别可能与负责发票和付款的“艺术家支付”域的识别不同。但是，为了能够在不同域数据产品之间关联艺术家的数据，我们需要就如何将艺术家识别为多义词达成共识。一种方法是考虑具有联合实体的“艺术家”和“艺术家”的唯一全局联合实体标识符，这与管理联合身份的方式类似。

Interoperability and standardization of communications, governed globally, is one of the foundational pillars for building distributed systems.
受全球监管的通信的互操作性和标准化是构建分布式系统的基础支柱之一。

##### 安全并受全局访问控制 Secure and governed by a global access control

Accessing product datasets securely is a must, whether the architecture is centralized or not. In the world of decentralized domain oriented data products, the access control is applied at a finer granularity, for each domain data product. Similarly to operational domains the access control policies can be defined centrally but applied at the time of access to each individual dataset product. Using the Enterprise Identity Management system (SSO) and Role Based Access Control policy definition is a convenient way to implement product datasets access control.
无论体系结构是否集中化，必须安全地访问产品数据集。在分散的面向域的数据产品的世界中，对每个域数据产品都以更精细的粒度应用访问控制。与操作域类似，访问控制策略可以集中定义，但在访问每个单独的数据集产品时应用。使用企业身份管理系统（SSO） 和基于角色的访问控制策略定义是实现产品数据集访问控制的便捷方法。

Section Data and self-service platform design convergence describes the shared infrastructure that enables the above capabilities for each data product easily and automatically.
部分 数据和自助服务平台的设计融合描述了共享的基础架构，可以轻松地和自动启用每个数据产品上面的能力。

#### 域数据跨职能团队 Domain data cross-functional teams

Domains that provide data as products; need to be augmented with new skill sets: (a) the data product owner and (b) data engineers.
将数据作为产品提供的域；需要增加新的技能：（a）数据产品所有者和（b）数据工程师。

A data product owner makes decisions around the vision and the roadmap for the data products, concerns herself with satisfaction of her consumers and continuously measures and improves the quality and richness of the data her domain owns and produces. She is responsible for the lifecycle of the domain datasets, when to change, revise and retire data and schemas. She strikes a balance between the competing needs of the domain data consumers.
数据产品所有者围绕数据产品的愿景和路线图做出决策，使自己对消费者的满意度感到关注，并不断衡量和提高其域拥有和生产的数据的质量和丰富性。她负责域数据集的生命周期，以及何时更改，修订和淘汰数据和模式。她在域数据使用者的竞争需求之间取得了平衡。

Data product owners must define success criteria and business-aligned Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for their data products. For example, the lead time for consumers of a data product to discover and use the data product successfully, is measurable success criteria.
数据产品所有者必须为其数据产品定义成功标准和与业务相关的关键绩效指标（KPI）。例如，数据产品的消费者成功发现和使用数据产品的提前期是可衡量的成功标准。

In order to build and operate the internal data pipelines of the domains, teams must include data engineers. A wonderful side effect of such cross-functional team is cross pollination of different skills. My current industry observation is that some data engineers, while competent in using the tools of their trade, lack software engineering standard practices, such as continuous delivery and automated testing, when it comes to building data assets. Similarly software engineers who are building operational systems often have no experience utilizing data engineering tool sets. Removing the skillset silos will lead to creation of a larger and deeper pool of data engineering skill sets available to the organization. We have observed the same cross-skill pollination with the DevOps movement, and the birth of new types of engineers such as SREs.
为了构建和运行域的内部数据管道，团队必须包括数据工程师。这种跨职能团队的一个奇妙副作用是不同技能的异花授粉。我目前的行业观察是，一些数据工程师虽然能够使用其交易工具，但在构建数据资产时缺乏软件工程标准实践，例如连续交付和自动化测试。同样，构建操作系统的软件工程师通常也没有使用数据工程工具集的经验。消除技能组孤岛将导致创建可供组织使用的更大更深的数据工程技能库。我们已经观察到与DevOps运动相同的跨技能授粉，以及新型工程师的诞生，例如 SRE。

Data must be treated a foundational piece of any software ecosystem, hence software engineers and software generalists must add the experience and knowledge of data product development to their tool belt. Similarly infrastructure engineers need to add knowledge and experience of managing a data infrastructure. Organizations must provide career development pathways from a generalist to a data engineer. The lack of data engineering skills has led to the local optimization of forming centralized data engineering teams as described in section Siloed and hyper-specialized ownership.
数据必须被视为任何软件生态系统的基础，因此软件工程师和软件通才必须将数据产品开发的经验和知识添加到他们的工具带中。同样，基础架构工程师也需要增加管理数据基础架构的知识和经验。组织必须提供从通才 到数据工程师的职业发展途径。数据工程技能的缺乏导致局部优化，如孤立的和超专业的所有权一节中所述，组建了集中的数据工程团队 。

### 数据和自助平台设计融合 Data and self-serve platform design convergence

One of the main concerns of distributing the ownership of data to the domains is the duplicated effort and skills required to operate the data pipelines technology stack and infrastructure in each domain. Luckily, building common infrastructure as a platform is a well understood and solved problem; though admittedly the tooling and techniques are not as mature in the data ecosystem.
将数据所有权分配给域的主要问题之一是在每个域中操作数据管道技术堆栈和基础架构所需的重复工作和技能。幸运的是，将通用基础结构构建为平台是一个众所周知的问题，并且已经得到解决。尽管可以肯定的是，工具和技术在数据生态系统中还不成熟。

Harvesting and extracting domain agnostic infrastructure capabilities into a data infrastructure platform solves the need for duplicating the effort of setting up data pipeline engines, storage, and streaming infrastructure. A data infrastructure team can own and provide the necessary technology that the domains need to capture, process, store and serve their data products.
将域不可知的基础架构功能收集和提取到数据基础架构平台中，解决了重复设置数据管道引擎，存储和流基础架构的工作。数据基础架构团队可以拥有并提供域捕获，处理，存储和服务其数据产品所需的必要技术。

![figure-11](data-mesh-fig11.png)
图11：提取和收集与域无关的数据管道基础架构，并将工具构建到作为平台的独立数据基础架构中
Figure 11: Extracting and harvesting domain agnostic data pipeline infrastructure and tooling into a separate data infrastructure as a platform

The key to building the data infrastructure as a platform is (a) to not include any domain specific concepts or business logic, keeping it domain agnostic, and (b) make sure the platform hides all the underlying complexity and provides the data infrastructure components in a self-service manner. There is a long list of capabilities that a self-serve data infrastructure as a platform provides to its users, a domain's data engineers. Here are a few of them:
将数据基础架构构建为平台的关键是（a）不包含任何特定于域的概念或业务逻辑，使其保持域不可知性；以及（b）确保平台隐藏了所有潜在的复杂性并在其中提供数据基础架构组件自助方式。自助数据基础架构作为平台向用户（域的数据工程师）提供的功能种类繁多。这里有几个：

    Scalable polyglot big data storage
    Encryption for data at rest and in motion
    Data product versioning
    Data product schema
    Data product de-identification
    Unified data access control and logging
    Data pipeline implementation and orchestration
    Data product discovery, catalog registration and publishing
    Data governance and standardization
    Data product lineage
    Data product monitoring/alerting/log
    Data product quality metrics (collection and sharing)
    In memory data caching
    Federated identity management
    Compute and data locality
    
    可扩展的多语言大数据存储
    静态和动态数据加密
    数据产品版本控制
    数据产品架构
    数据产品去识别
    统一的数据访问控制和记录
    数据管道实施和编排
    数据产品发现，目录注册和发布
    数据治理与标准化
    数据产品沿袭
    数据产品监控/报警/日志
    数据产品质量指标（收集和共享）
    内存中数据缓存
    联合身份管理
    计算和数据局部性


A success criteria for self-serve data infrastructure is lowering the 'lead time to create a new data product' on the infrastructure. This leads to automation, required for implementing the capabilities of a 'data product' as covered in section Domain data as a product. For example, automating data ingestion through configurations and scripts, data product creation scripts to put scaffolding in place, auto-registering a data product with the catalog, etc.
自助数据基础架构的成功标准是减少基础架构上的“创建新数据产品的前置时间”。这会导致实现“数据产品”功能所需的自动化，这在“将域数据作为产品”部分 中进行了介绍。例如，通过配置和脚本自动执行数据提取，将支架放置到位的数据产品创建脚本，在目录中自动注册数据产品等。 

Using cloud infrastructure as a substrate reduces the operational costs and effort required to provide on-demand access to the data infrastructure, however it doesn't completely remove the higher abstractions that need to be put in place in the context of the business. Regardless of the cloud provider there is a rich and ever growing set of data infrastructure services that are available to the data infra team.
使用云基础架构作为基础可以减少提供按需访问数据基础架构所需的运营成本和工作量，但是并不能完全消除需要在业务环境中进行部署的高级抽象。无论云提供商如何，数据基础架构团队都可以使用一组丰富且不断增长的数据基础架构服务。

## 范式向数据网格转移 The paradigm shift towards a data mesh

It's been a long read. Let's bring it all together. We looked at some of the underlying characteristics of the current data platforms: centralized, monolithic, with highly coupled pipeline architecture, operated by silos of hyper-specialized data engineers. We introduced the building blocks of a ubiquitous data mesh as a platform; distributed data products oriented around domains and owned by independent cross-functional teams who have embedded data engineers and data product owners, using common data infrastructure as a platform to host, prep and serve their data assets.
已经读了很长时间了。让我们一起来。我们研究了当前数据平台的一些基本特征： 集中式，整体式，高度耦合的管道 架构，由超专业数据工程师的孤岛操作。我们介绍了作为平台的无处不在的数据网格的构建模块 ； 面向领域的分布式数据产品，由独立的跨职能团队拥有，这些团队具有嵌入式数据工程师和数据产品所有者，使用通用数据基础结构作为平台来托管，准备和服务其数据资产。

The data mesh platform is an intentionally designed distributed data architecture, under centralized governance and standardization for interoperability, enabled by a shared and harmonized self-serve data infrastructure. I hope it is clear that it is far from a landscape of fragmented silos of inaccessible data.
数据网格平台是经过精心设计的分布式数据体系结构，在集中管理和标准化下实现互操作性，并通过共享和统一的自助式数据基础结构实现。我希望很明显，它与无法访问的数据零散孤岛的景象相去甚远。

![figure-12](data-mesh-fig12.png)
图12：30,000英尺视角的数据网格架构
Figure 12: Data mesh architecture from 30,000 foot view

You might ask where does the data lake or data warehouse fit in this architecture? They are simply nodes on the mesh. It's very likely that we won't need a data lake, because the distributed logs and storage that hold the original data are available for exploration from different addressable immutable datasets as products. However, in cases where we do need to make changes to the original format of the data for further exploration, such as labeling, the domain with such need might create its own lake or data hub.
您可能会问，数据湖或数据仓库在此体系结构中适合什么位置？它们只是网格上的节点。我们很有可能不需要数据湖，因为保存原始数据的分布式日志和存储可用于从作为产品的不同可寻址不可变数据集中进行探索。但是，如果确实需要更改数据的原始格式以进行进一步的探索（例如标记），则有此需求的域可能会创建自己的湖泊或数据中心。

Accordingly, the data lake is no longer the centerpiece of the overall architecture. We will continue to apply some of the principles of data lake, such as making immutable data available for explorations and analytical usage, to the source oriented domain data products. We will continue to use the data lake tooling, however either for internal implementation of data products or as part of the shared data infrastructure.
因此，数据湖不再是整个体系结构的核心。我们将继续对面向源的领域数据产品应用数据湖的某些原理，例如使不可变数据可用于勘探和分析用途 。我们将继续使用数据湖工具，但是将其用于数据产品的内部实施或作为共享数据基础结构的一部分。

This, in fact, takes us back to where it all began: James Dixon in 2010 intended a data lake to be used for a single domain, multiple data domains would instead form a 'water garden'.
实际上，这使我们回到了一切的起点： 2010年，詹姆斯·迪克森（James Dixon）打算将一个数据湖用于单个域，而多个数据域将形成一个“水花园”。

The main shift is to treat domain data product as a first class concern, and data lake tooling and pipeline as a second class concern - an implementation detail. This inverts the current mental model from a centralized data lake to an ecosystem of data products that play nicely together, a data mesh.
主要转变是将域数据产品视为第一类关注点，而将数据湖工具和管道视为第二类关注点-实现细节。这将当前的思维模型从集中式数据湖转变为可以很好地协同工作的数据产品生态系统，即数据网格。 

The same principle applies to the data warehouse for business reporting and visualization. It's simply a node on the mesh, and possibly on the consumer oriented edge of the mesh.
相同的原则适用于用于业务报告和可视化的数据仓库。它只是网格上的一个节点，并且可能位于网格的面向消费者的边缘上。

I admit that though I see the data mesh practices being applied in pockets at my clients, enterprise scale adoption still has a long way to go. I don't believe technology is the limitation here, all the tooling that we use today can accommodate distribution and ownership by multiple teams. Particularly the shift towards unification of batch and streaming and tools such as Apache Beam or Google Cloud Dataflow, easily allow processing addressable polyglot datasets.
我承认，尽管我看到数据网格实践已在我的客户的口袋中应用，但是企业规模的采用仍然有很长的路要走。我不认为技术是这里的限制，我们今天使用的所有工具都可以容纳多个团队的分配和所有权。特别是向批处理和流传输以及诸如Apache Beam或 Google Cloud Dataflow之类的工具 统一的转变，可以轻松地处理可寻址的多语种数据集。

Data catalog platforms such as Google Cloud Data Catalog provide central discoverability, access control and governance of distributed domain datasets. A wide variety of cloud data storage options enables domain data products to choose fit for purpose polyglot storage.
诸如Google Cloud Data Catalog之类的数据目录平台 提供了集中的可发现性，访问控制和分布式域数据集的治理。多种云数据存储选项使域数据产品可以选择适合用途的多语言存储。

The needs are real and tools are ready. It is up to the engineers and leaders in organizations to realize that the existing paradigm of big data and one true big data platform or data lake, is only going to repeat the failures of the past, just using new cloud based tools.
需求是真实的，工具已经准备就绪。由组织的工程师和领导者来认识到 ，仅使用新的基于云的工具，现有的大数据范例和一个真正的大数据平台或数据湖就只会重复过去的失败。

This paradigm shift requires a new set of governing principles accompanied with a new language:
这种范式转换需要一套新的管理原则以及一种新的语言：

    serving over ingesting
    discovering and using over extracting and loading
    Publishing events as streams over flowing data around via centralized pipelines
    Ecosystem of data products over centralized data platform
    
    服务过摄取
    发现和使用过度提取和加载
    发布事件流过周围流动的数据通过管道集中
    数据产品生态系统过度集中的数据平台


Let's breakdown the big data monolith into a harmonized, collaborative and distributed ecosystem of data mesh.
让我们将大数据整体分解为数据网格的协调，协作和分布式生态系统。
